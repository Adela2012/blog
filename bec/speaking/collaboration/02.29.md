1. How important is the brand image in marketing campaign?
1. What factors should be considered when selecting a company logo design?
1. Do you think it important for a company to have a logo of its own?

### Suggested answer
1. Yes. In the eyes of the public, a clearly defined company image is the identity of the company. It reflects the quality of their product or service. So a good company image enhances public recognition and increased popularity will translate into great trading volume and profits.
1. Brand image is an integrated part of marketing strategy. Although the success of a marketing compaign is determined by product quality, budget and some other to drive people to your business.
1. When selecting a logo design, the company's image and target audience should be put high on the prority list. The logo should reflect the cultural values the company upholds, and the attractive to the targeted potential customers. Of course, cost is another factor to be considered.
1. Yes. I think a logo represents a company and its products or services. If the logo is successful, it captures the personality of the company, sculpts and reinforces the company image. Besides, the logo is a most central marketing tool as it is used consistently and repeatedly.



## Part Two: Mini-presentation
What's important when...?
Designing a company logo
- company image
- logo copyright

### Suggested answer
When designing a company logo, company image is an important factor to consider. Because the logo introduces and portrays the company before the public eyes. Company logo represents your company's identity, reflects the main point of your company, its values and help in the successful developmennt of the business.

In addition to this, logo copyright is also important. a corporate logo is legally regarded as being a work of artistic creation including all the design elements, not just the name on its own. Therefore, it is protected under copyright law. So when designing a company logo, you have to make sure that you do not infringe upon another company's logo collectioin.

Apart from the two points, you also need to consider cultural differences in designing the logo graphic, particularly if your company is a multi-national one. And of course, cost is another important factor to be considered.




## Part Three: Collaborative Task and Discussion
### Business PowerPoint Presentation Skills Training
Your company would like to design a new Company Celebration Programme to facilitate both internal and external communications. 
You have been asked to help draft the programme, Discuss tthe situation together, and decide: 
- what kinds of events should be celebrated
- how to celebrate these occasions

### Suggested answer
1. It's important to `make a detailed pla`n about what events to be celebrated.
1. successful corporate rituals and celebrations are important ways of corporate communications. They help to bond people together and connect people to shared values and vision. So a well designed corporate celebration programme will benefit a company greatly.
1. Yes. But as there is a wide variety of situations that we can celebrate, we have to focus on the most worthy ones. In my opinion, we can keep the cyclical celebrations, as they are more fixed, I mean, they come every year, like company anniversaries, Christmas, New Year's Day, etc. Celebrations of this kind help to relieve work pressure.
1. We can hold parties, costume balls, gettogethers at selected restaurants, etc. We can also invite our clients and customers over as these activities are really great occasioins for socialising and networking, I mean good chances for building relationships.
1. We can also hold ceremonies when our staff members or teams produce excellent performance. It's a way of showing our recognition and appreciation for their efforts. And in return, celebrations of this kind help to enhance job satisfaction and will further help to improve the quality and financial performance of our company.

1. On these occasions, we can choose to offer free trips, picnics or get-togethers, etc.
1. Besides that, I think we should create celebrations that include everyone. I mean, no one should be left out. So personal transitions should also be celebrated. They often affect how well people perform in work, although personal transitions are private in nature.
1. They also affect how smoothly organisations function in a way. So the management should respond well to personal events such as marriage, the birth of a child, or employee birthday etc. , and deal with these happy events effectively. They can organise parties, buffet or picnics.

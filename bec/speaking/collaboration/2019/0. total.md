Organizing a conference
- Conference speakers
- Facilities at conference centre
- Minutes of the conference
- Food

To organize a conference well, many things should be considered.
ðŸŽˆFirstly, communicate with the `speakers` before coference, to get to know the basic outline of their speeches, and to talk about the time they are going to use. speakers should leave enough time to summarize.
ðŸŽˆNext, get all the `facilities` and check whether they are working properly.  For a confeerencee requiring simultaneous interpretation, the booths and equipment shall be installed and checked before the conference. The microphones for the speakers should work well.
ðŸŽˆ`Minutes of the conference` should be made, which is convenient for future supplement. Ask someone to take conference minutes. Before the conference starts its work, the minutes of the last conference should be distributed to the participants.
ðŸŽˆLastly, `food` is another important part. Consider the background of the participants of the conference and provide proper `food` for them.

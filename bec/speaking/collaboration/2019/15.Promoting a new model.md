- The `appearance has a strong sense of luxury`.  It's good to be operate. It is will be very attractive to young people.

1. That is the most recently developed model of the company. The target consumers are aged between 18 to 25 years old. Now, ☀️`let’s have a discussion about how to promote it`. Please fell free to share with us whatever it is in your mind.

2. At first sight, I’m really positive that `the prime user of this model` will be youngster rather than the middle aged. Look at the car! 🎈It is of `compact size`, yet with `modernized outfits`, really appealing to young and fashionable people. I think this is `the real pluses` of it.

3. I think the features of the model just speak for themselves. The only thing we need to do is try to `get our potential buyers to take a look at the car`.  ☀️So `how to do advertising campaign to present the car`. 我认为这个模型的特点是不言而喻的。我们唯一需要做的就是“让潜在的买主看看这辆车”。

  3. We are probably looking at the best seller of this season. But don't forget that our competitors have also launched new models recently. So we need to do a good advertising campaign to against them.

5. 🎈We can `invite pop stars to present the model`, and then the `new model will appeal to the youngsters`. 

6. So we need to design everything on a target-based strategy. I believe the so called `'star-effect' will work`.

7. According to a recent survey, the consumers do `care about who is presenting the product`. We should `take advantage of it`.

8. 🎈`The launching of the new model needs perfect timing`. I believe `autumn is a good reason`. Because it is a time when students left college and go forth into the word. Some of them will find themselves in great need of a vehicle to communicate to their working cities.

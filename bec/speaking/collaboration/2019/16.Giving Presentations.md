16.Giving Presentations

# which types of staff would benefit most from this training
# how to decide whether training has been successful

And the board is considering establishing trade relations with China and expanding into the Japanese market.

1. The managing director is concerned about the quality of presentations given by staff at internal and external meetings. Under this circumstance, we will need more marketing staff to give presentations. ☀️`let’s have a discussion about how to plan for training for successful business presentations`

2. We have to draw up a tentative plan for business presentation. 

3. it's a wise choice to consider every possibility and prepare for it. Later on, although minor alternations can be made, we can avoid lots of trouble. 

2. 🎈`I think the staff from the marketing department would benefit most from the training`, because they do business presentation quite often.

5. anything do you want to bring up for discussion? 

6. You convinced me. ☀️`But I’d like to say that the evaluation is also an essential part of the plan. I mean how could we know the staff really benefit from the training or not? `

7. Since the staff from the marketing department do business presentations quite often, 🎈`I think we can refer to their comment on the training`. If they speak highly of the trainer and give us a positive feedback, then it means a lot. 

8. we can send questionnaire after training, to ask their evaluation. It is confirmed by the feedback of the staff

## Part One: Interview
### Interlocutor's questions

1. Are there any advantages of filling openings from internal sources?
1. What do you think of recruiting employees through the Internet?
1. Are there any advantages of external recruitment?
1. When interviewing candidates, which do you prefer, traditional one-to-one interview, or the panel interview?

### Suggested answer
1. Promotion-from-within has some motivational[ˌməʊtɪˈveɪʃənl] value. It is a kind of reward for employees for their past performamce, and will encourage them to continue their efforts['efəts]. This can imporve morale [məˈrɑːl] within the organisation. Furthermore, the transferred employee is more familiar with organisation. It can reduce the orientation [ˌɔːriənˈteɪʃn] and training costs.
1. It is a new and modern source of recruitmennt and is becoming popular. Undoubtedly, Internet recruiting is of low cost and wide coverage[ˈkʌvərɪdʒ], which can reach a large audience of possible applicants and is very convenient.
1. Yes. It is essential for revitalizing [ˌriːˈvaɪtəlaɪz] the organisations. Applicants hired from the outside can be a source of new ideas, and may bring along with them the lastst knowledge acquired from their previous employment.
1. I prefer the traditional one-to-one interview, because it can reduce recruiting costs. In my opinion, the number of interviewers isn't as important as the capability, personality and experience of an interviewer.

## Part Two: Mini-presentation
What is important when... ?
Selecting an employment interviewer
- personal quality 
- interviewing skills
When selecting an employment interviewer, 🎈`personal qualities` are important, which can ensure his decision sound and fair. Qualities desirable include  humility [hjuːˈmɪləti], the ability to think objectively and poise[pɔɪz].
In addition to qualities, 🎈`interviewing skills`, such as the skill to raise question, is also important. For instance, questions concerning marital[ˈmærɪtl] status are generally recognized as inappropriate[,inə'prəupriət]. But there are some cases when you have to get some information of the applicant's marital status, so with the necessary skill, you can ask in this way -- what is the name, address and telephone number of a person we may contact in case of an emergency? This question is perfectly legal and appropriate.
Besides, 🎈`experience in associating with people from various backgrounds` is also vital because the workforce of a company is varied and diverse. Training, of course, can not be neglected [ni'ɡlektid].

## Part Three: Collaborative Task and Discussion
### Advertising for Job Opening
Your company is going to fill the job vacancy of 10 salespersons by advertising. You have been asked to make recommendations. Discuss the situation together, and decide: 
- What type of publication is to choose
- What are to be included in the advertisements

### Suggested answer
1. When choosing a publication, we should `consider its readers`. We should make sure whether it is directed to wide range of readers or just to a particular group. 
1. Besides, it's also important to consider advertising fee. The `advertising cost` should be reasonable and affordable, somewhere around the company's budget.
1. Exactly. So, in our case, we should choose a local publication instead of a national one. `An influential local newspaper` is a good choice. Besides, its advertising is the cheapest way of reaching large number of readers of varous backgrounds.
1. To recuit the right person, we should also consider the contents of the advertisement. 
1. In my opinion, Besides `the basic information` as time, place and contact address, `the description of applicants' qualification` and `the specifications of the openings` should be included, because it can cut down the number of applicants and  attract the desirable ones.
1. To attract ideal applicants, it's also necessary for our job advertisement to show the `specific benefits` that our company can offer.
1. This is also a chance to publicize the image of our company. To do this well, the advertisement should be well-designed and `cover general information of our company`.

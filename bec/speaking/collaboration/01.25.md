## Part One: Interview
### Interlocutor's questions

1. Are there any advantages of filling openings from internal sources?
1. What do you think of recruiting employees through the Internet?
1. Are there any advantages of external recruitment?
1. When interviewing candidates, which do you prefer, traditional one-to-one interview, or the panel interview?

### Suggested answer
1. Promotion-from-within has some motivational[ˌməʊtɪˈveɪʃənl] value. It is a kind of reward for employees, and will encourage them to continue their efforts['efəts]. Furthermore, the transferred employee is more familiar with organisation. It can reduce the orientation [ˌɔːriənˈteɪʃn] and training costs.
1. Internet recruiting is the most popular way in modern society. It's of low cost and wide coverage[ˈkʌvərɪdʒ]. And it can reach a large audience of possible applicants. It's also convenient for companies.
1. Yes. It's essential for revitalizing [ˌriːˈvaɪtəlaɪz] the organisations. Companies can hire the best talent in the market. And applicants hired from the outside can be a source of new ideas, which can bring a lot of positive change in the company.
1. I prefer the traditional one-to-one interview, because it can reduce recruiting costs. In my opinion, the number of interviewers isn't as important as the capability, personality and experience of an interviewer.

## Part Two: Mini-presentation
What is important when... ?
Selecting an employment interviewer
- personal quality 
- interviewing skills
When selecting an employment interviewer, 🎈`personal qualities` are important, which can ensure his decision sound and fair. The ability to think objectively and poise[pɔɪz] can prevent extreme opinions, and avoid employment discrimination.
In addition to qualities, 🎈`interviewing skills`, such as the skill to raise question, is also important. For instance, questions, concerning[kənˈsɜːnɪŋ] marital[ˈmærɪtl] status are generally recognized as inappropriate[,inə'prəupriət]. So with the necessary skill, you can ask in this way -- what's the name, address and telephone number of a person we may contact in case of an emergency? This question is appropriate.
Besides, 🎈`experience in associating with people from various backgrounds` is also vital, because the workforce of a company is varied and diverse. Training, of course, can not be neglected [ni'ɡlektid].

## Part Three: Collaborative Task and Discussion
### Advertising for Job Opening
Your company is going to fill the job vacancy of 10 salespersons by advertising. You have been asked to make recommendations. Discuss the situation together, and decide: 
- What type of publication is to choose
- What are to be included in the advertisements

### Suggested answer
1. When choosing a publication, we should `consider its readers`. We should make sure whether it is directed to wide range of readers or just to a particular group. 
1. Besides, it's also important to consider advertising fee. The `advertising cost` should be reasonable and affordable, somewhere around the company's budget.
1. Exactly. So, in our case, we should choose a local publication instead of a national one. `An influential [ˌɪnfluˈenʃl] local recruitement website` is a good choice. It is the most popular way of reaching large number of certain job seekers. Besides, It's of low cost and wide coverage[ˈkʌvərɪdʒ].
1. To recuit the right person, we should also consider the contents of the advertisement. 
1. In my opinion, Besides `the basic information` as time, place and contact address, `the description of applicants' qualification` and `the specifications of the openings` should be included, because it can cut down the number of applicants and  attract the desirable ones.
1. To attract ideal applicants, it's also necessary for our job advertisement to show the `specific benefits` that our company can offer.
1. This is also a chance to publicize the image of our company. To do this well, the advertisement should be well-designed and `cover general information of our company`.

Selling old stock

- whether to offer the same discount on all products.
- how customers could be informed of the discounts.

#  We have to work out a plan to deal with old stock which has just been sorted out from our warehouse. 

We don't have much time left. Because the new products are supposed to arrive at early next month.

So we have two weeks left and we must hurry up.

Yes, I agree with you. The most important thing at this time is to sell off the stock and make space for our new products. 


1. I prefer the same discount because people don't like calculating, it is easy to catch attention and easy to handle.

2. we can use a lower discount such as 30%, it will truely appeal to the customers. As long as they're attracted, they come in and buy our products. It's business skills.

They are attracted by a 30% discount. And then they find our products are actually offered with different discounts, they would feel being cheated. 


 # Now let's move to next term. how can we inform customers the discounts.

1. we can `advertise our sale on TV, radio, and newspaper`.
2. There’s an alternative, we can `print leaflets` and `distribute them` on the street and in the communities. In this way we can attract a lot of people’s attention `at a low cost`.
3. Good idea, we can also `send emails or messages to our customers`, and publish the news of our sale on line, and it’s particular free!

Wonderful! It seems everything has been work out for selling our old stock.

开阔员工的眼界，学习语言，关于另一个国家的商业模式。


1. 🌞`Our company is planning to send a trade delegation to Japan to develop the potential market there. What’s your proposal of the trip`? 

2. No wonder Jeffery and Thompson were brushing up their Japanese recently. They said they overheard something about this plan but it was still a pending issue. Is it too early to plan for sending delegation there? 🎈`As far as I am concerned, there is not yet enough market survey backing up the plan. `

3. It might appear that way. But in spite of this disadvantage, we still ought to do something whereas our major competitors are invading into the ready market.🎈`Anyway, to give it a shot is better than stay watching. And after all, it's a perfect opportunity to expand our horizon. `

4. `I believe the advantage outweighs the disadvantage`. 🌞`Now, let's think about what kinds of information about doing  business in the country the staff need to know before the trip, and make sure we send a strong team there.` 

5. OK, let's make a list of what should be planned in advance. Firstly, 🎈`I think the delegation member must have a good command of the language and local bisiness manners`.

6. You are saying exactly what I'm thinking about. `It all depend on the language communication to inquire about possibilities of doing business there`. So, let’s make it our priority. 

`And different countries have different traditions and culture, And we need to give a good impression in the major cities of the country.`

7. You just mentioned business manner. I definitely agree with you there. As an Asian country, Japanese share some culture with china, but we also have traditions that do not coincide with each other. One of the objectives of the trip is to give a good impression in the major cities of Japan. 🎈`We should make the staff clear about the goal of their mission and get them fully prepared for this assignment. `

8. 🎈`It is also urgent to come up with what products the delegation should take with along the trip and in what way they should present them to the Japanese. `

9. Could you go over it again? I didn’t catch up with it.

10. Ok, let me clarify my statement.🎈` I mean we should prepare some products of our company. And we should think about how to promote them in the Japanese market. `

11. Got it. We have to prepare something with real pluses at a reasonably quick tempo. We can ask our candidates to think about some options. Personally, I don’t think we should retain the same style. I don’t have anything in particular in my mind right now, and I can’t say it for certain off-hand, but I assume that we be a little bit creative on this issue because we are there to `make ourselves being heard and saw`. 

12. It is your specialist to invent and create. You can be in charge of this part of the work. I am looking forward to your bright idea. 

13. I am into this idea as well. And that will be a great achievement.
